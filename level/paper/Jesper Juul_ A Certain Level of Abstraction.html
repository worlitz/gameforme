<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">This paper explores
  levels of abstraction: Representational games present a fictional
  world, but within that world, players are only allowed to perform
  certain actions; the fictional world of the game is only implemented
  to a certain detail.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The paper distinguishes
  between abstraction as a core element of video game design,
  abstraction as something that the player decodes while playing a
  game, and abstraction as a type of optimization that the player
  builds over time.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Finally, the paper
  argues that abstraction is related to the magic circle of games and
  to rules as such.</p>

<h1 class="western">Introduction</h1>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Video games are
approaching their 50-year anniversary, and the history of games spans
millennia. The game developer and the game player are equally
immersed in the culture of video games: a new game is developed
borrowing from and referring to conventions and genres of previous
games, and a player picks up a game and understands it in relation to
conventions and genres that the player already knows.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The video game
  researcher is no less immersed in the culture of video games, and
  many conventions may be taken for granted. Perhaps the best thing to
  do is to ask naïve questions. I will begin by asking: <i>Why am
    I not allowed order take-out?</i></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
</p>
<h1 class="western">No take-out</h1>
<p class="western" align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><img src="./Jesper Juul_ A Certain Level of Abstraction_files/index_html_md752051_200.jpg" alt="Cooking Mama" width="200" height="300" border="0" align="BOTTOM"></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-left: 2.54cm; margin-right: 2.54cm; margin-top: 0.21cm; page-break-after: avoid" lang="da-DK">
<font size="2">Figure 1. <span lang="da-DK"><i>Cooking
Mama</i></span> (Office Create 2006).</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><i>Cooking Mama</i>
(figure 1, Office Create 2006) is a game about cooking: The player
must prepare ingredients, chop vegetables, and control the heat on
the stove in order to create a number of dishes.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The game is a type of
double signal: The game illustrates a kitchen, a person in the
kitchen, a number of ingredients - that is, a fictional world. But
the game also signals that this is not a kitchen. The player cannot
do everything that can be done in a kitchen: <i>Cooking Mama </i>lets
the player slice a cucumber, but only a specific type of slice. The
player can cook, but the player cannot decide to order take-out
instead of cooking.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><i>Cooking Mama</i>,
like other representational games, has a <i>level of abstraction</i>
- the player can only act on a certain level, outside which the world
is either crudely implemented as in the case of the ingredients,
simply represented as in the case of the table cloth, or simply
absent, as in the case of the world outside the kitchen.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">If we assume the
perspective that games have two complementary elements of <i>rules</i>
and <i>fiction</i> [5], all content in a game can either be purely
fictional and not implemented in the rules (such as in the case of a
game's back story), purely rules and unexplained by the fiction (such
as the multiple lives of a player), or in the zone in between, where
the rules of the game are motivated by the game's fiction (cars that
can drive, birds that can fly, etc.). (Figure 2). The combination of
rules and fiction is sometimes described as <i>virtual</i> or
<i>simulation </i>[1].</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><img src="./Jesper Juul_ A Certain Level of Abstraction_files/index_html_1bd114d9.gif" alt="Where to find the level of abstraction" width="310" height="231"></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-left: 2.54cm; margin-right: 2.54cm; margin-top: 0.21cm; page-break-after: avoid" lang="da-DK">
<font size="2"><span lang="en-US">Figure 2. Level of abstraction: A
line between the purely fiction and the fiction that is implemented
in the rules of a game.</span></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The level of
abstraction concerns the border between the content that is purely
fictional and the content that is presented in the fiction as well as
implemented in the rules of a game.</p>
<h2 class="western">Abstraction as design</h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Abstraction can be
illustrated through a language metaphor. Language can describe action
on different levels of detail. Going to work can be described as
exactly that - "going to work", or it can be listed as a
number of individual steps such as "open front door, walk to
subway, take subway, leave subway, walk to work", going down to
a description of the concrete path to walk, or even the individual
muscles to activate<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote1anc" href="https://www.jesperjuul.net/text/acertainlevel/#sdendnote1sym"><sup>i</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">This demonstrates that
there is no natural level of <i>description</i> for a specific
action. In the cooking example, any level of detail from selecting
the dish, to controlling the muscles of the hand holding the knife
can be imagined. However, changing the level of abstraction would
make <i>Cooking Mama</i> a different game: the level of abstraction
identifies a specific game and game genre. For example, the casual
game <i>Diner Dash: Flo on the Go</i> (figure 3, PlayFirst 2006) is
about running a restaurant. Plausibly, the chef in the game is
cooking food like in <i>Cooking Mama</i>, but that action is not
available to the player. Though the two games could be conceived as
being part of the same fictional world, they are completely different
games due to their differing level of abstraction.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The level of
abstraction is <i>the level on which the player can act</i>: The
actions that are available to the player<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote2anc" href="https://www.jesperjuul.net/text/acertainlevel/#sdendnote2sym"><sup>ii</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<h2 class="western">Decoding abstraction</h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">This discussion of
abstraction in <i>Cooking Mama</i> and <i>Diner Dash: Flo on the Go</i>
is a view of the two games <i>in retrospect</i>, from the vantage
point of having played these games for a while. But playing games is
actually a process of exploring abstraction. As players, we come to
new games and especially new game genres not knowing the level of
abstraction. Consider two classic real-time strategy games,
<i>StarCraft</i> (Blizzard 1998) and <i>Age of Empires </i>(Ensemble
Studios 1999) (figure 4).</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><img src="./Jesper Juul_ A Certain Level of Abstraction_files/index_html_4ab80c98_300.jpg" alt="StarCraft" width="300" height="225" border="0" align="BOTTOM">
<br>
<br><img src="./Jesper Juul_ A Certain Level of Abstraction_files/index_html_m62543ae5_300.jpg" alt="Age of Empires III" width="300" height="240" border="0" align="BOTTOM"></p>
<p lang="da-DK" style="margin-left: 2.54cm; margin-right: 2.54cm; margin-top: 0.21cm; page-break-after: avoid">
<font size="2"><span lang="en-US">Figure 4. </span><span lang="da-DK"><i>StarCraft</i></span><span lang="en-US">
(Blizzard 1998) and </span><span lang="da-DK"><i>Age
of Empires II</i></span><span lang="en-US"> (Ensemble Studios
1999)</span></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The initial impression
of these two games is very different depending on the player's
experience with real-time strategy games.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The <b>novice game
player</b> will likely try to make assumptions about the game based
on the something that the already player knows, in this case the
game's fiction. <i>Age of Empires II</i> has units and a setting that
the player can recognize from other media: The knights presumably
have some sort of battle function; the catapult is probably for
attacks on castles. There is a town, there are fields. The people on
the fields probably gather food in some way. From the setting, the
player has the possibility of making assumptions about the rule
structure of the game. But to a player unfamiliar with real-time
strategy games, <i>StarCraft</i> (and especially the <i>Zergs</i>
pictured here) yields little information about the rules of the game:
what are the blue crystals? What do the little critters do? This
makes <i>Age of Empires II</i> more accessible to new players,
because they can use the fiction to make inferences about the rules.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The <b>experienced game
player</b> can identify the genre of the games above based on the
number of units, the placement of resources, the birds-eye view, and
the general interface layout. That is, the experienced player comes
to the game with an idea of the rule structure of the game, and the
general limits in which the interaction take place: Tell units where
to go, but don't deal with the path finding of the individual unit.
Deal with battles, but not with making food. Accept that human units
can be "built" in a few minutes. However, the experienced
game player does not know where the borders lie in this specific
game. Perhaps this is a game that adds political or social structure
as new component to the real-time strategy genre? Perhaps in this
game, resource units become fatigued?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">This means that the
player's view of the game changes over time, while playing the game.
The designer's or theorists' view of the game is a retrospective
view, the view of an ideal player that has spent all the time needed
in the game and discovered all its secrets.</p>
<h2 class="western">Problem or opportunity?</h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">It could be tempting to
assume that given the right technology and sufficient amount of
resources, we could make a game that photo realistically looked like
a kitchen, simulated to an arbitrary level of detail. This was the
dream of virtual reality, or the holodeck [7], to have a game-like
experience without a level of abstraction: a game where anything was
possible and everything was simulated to any detail. In the virtual
reality <i>Cooking Mama</i>, we would finally be able to order
take-out or cook food just like in a real kitchen.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aarseth [1] has argued
that there is an important ontological difference between game doors
that <i>can</i> be opened compared to game doors that <i>can't</i> be
opened. Aarseth argues that the latter <i>cannot</i> be considered
<i>simulated</i> because they do not have the <i>function</i> of
opening. This argument rests on the assumption that for a given
object, we can list the functions that it <i>must</i> have in a game
in order to be considered part of the game. On the other hand, normal
doors have an infinite number of possible functions such as letting
people in, keeping people out, being painted, being removed from
their hinges, and so on. It is hard to imagine any object or action
being simulated "fully" in a game.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">With improvements in
video game technology and increasing game development budgets, the
idea of a hypothetical, perfect simulation has come to the forefront,
but some critical voices have also been heard. As game designer Frank
Lantz has put it:</p>
<p lang="da-DK" align="LEFT" style="margin-left: 0.5cm; margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">
<font size="2"><span lang="en-US">I think there is a widespread and
largely unexamined belief in this community that computer games are
evolving towards an infinitely detailed and utterly seamless
simulation. That this is their destiny. To evolve to a star trek
holodeck, a seamless simulation indistinguishable from real
experience. <br>[...]<br>Even if you could by some magic create this
impossible perfect simulation world, where would you be? You’d
need to stick a game in there. You’d need to make chess out of
the simulation rocks in your world. It’s like going back to
square one. I don’t wanna play chess again. I wanna play a game
that has the dense simulation and chess combined. This requires a
light touch. This requires respect for the gap. T</span><span lang="en-US">he
gap is part of your toolset. [11]</span></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Furthermore, it could
be argued that the role of abstraction is not simply to make the game
different from what it represents, but to make it different <i>for
specific purposes</i>. Chaim Gingold has compared game development to
the aesthetics of Japanese gardens:</p>
<p lang="da-DK" align="LEFT" style="margin-left: 0.5cm; margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">
<font size="2"><span lang="en-US">A miniature garden, like a snow
globe, model train set, or fish tank, is complete; nothing is
missing, and nothing can be taken away. Clear boundaries (spatial and
non-spatial), overviews, and a consistent level of abstraction work
hand in hand to make the miniature world believable, complete, and
tractable for both the author and player. </span><span lang="en-US">[2]</span></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gingold's view presents
abstraction as a productive way of representing a world. As a
supplementary view, since games can be both abstract and
representational, abstraction can be seen as the process by which <i>any</i>
given subject matter is transformed into game form. Consider the
fighting game <i>Dead Or Alive 4</i> in figure 5 (Tecmo, 2005).</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><img src="./Jesper Juul_ A Certain Level of Abstraction_files/index_html_769c880d_300.jpg" alt="Dead or Alive 4" width="300" height="169" border="0" align="BOTTOM"></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-left: 2.54cm; margin-right: 2.54cm; margin-top: 0.21cm; page-break-after: avoid" lang="da-DK">
<font size="2">Figure 5. <span lang="da-DK"><i>Dead
Or Alive 4 </i></span>(Tecmo 2005): A 2d game in a 3d world.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Even in this lavish
3-dimensional game world, the fighting is placed on a single axis
where the players are always facing each other. This can be motivated
in several ways - the amount of possible actions is more manageable
when players can only attack each other from the front or the back;
it makes the game easier to learn. More importantly, two-dimensional
gameplay is part of the genre's history, going back to early fighting
games such as <i>Street Fighter</i> (Capcom 1987) or <i>Karate Champ</i>
(figure 6, Data East 1984).</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><img src="./Jesper Juul_ A Certain Level of Abstraction_files/index_html_6c6e45fa_200.jpg" alt="Karate Champ" width="200" height="229" border="0" align="BOTTOM"></p>

Champ</i></span><span lang="en-US"> (Data East 1984): 2d in a
2d world.</span></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">This is an example of
an abstraction that remains part of the fighting genre, even when
technological advances would allow games to remove the abstraction.
Game design and game playing is not just oriented towards realism or
fidelity, but also towards the history of video games, and to the
conventions of a specific genre. The fighter genre retains the
convention that fighting should take place with the opponents placed
on a single axis, and thereby proves that the history of video games
is not simply driven by technological advances. Rather, a genre that
is well understood by game players and game designers can remain
stable over time.</p>
<h2 class="western">Abstraction of what?</h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">In the example of
<i>Cooking Mama</i>, I stated that it is a game <i>about cooking</i>:
If we assume this to be the case, it is straightforward to point to
many actions that are possible in a normal kitchen setting, but which
are not implemented in the game. From a player point of view, this
relies on being able to compare a set of assumptions about the
represented world (a kitchen), with the possibilities that the game
offers. In other words, the experience that a game is an abstraction
depends on the player identifying what the game is an <i>abstraction
of</i>. Consider the game in
figure 7. This game features a number of geometrical objects in
different colors.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><img src="./Jesper Juul_ A Certain Level of Abstraction_files/index_html_m324b50dd_300.jpg" alt="The Marriage" width="300" height="239" border="0" align="BOTTOM"></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-left: 2.54cm; margin-right: 2.54cm; margin-top: 0.21cm; page-break-after: avoid" lang="da-DK">
<font size="2"><span lang="en-US">Figure 7. (Humble 2006)</span></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Rod Humble's
experimental game is called <i>The Marriage</i>, and is meant to
illustrate the tensions and developments in a marriage, with the two
squares representing the partners and the circles representing the
external influences upon the relationship. As the author notes, this
is not something that players can generally intuit from seeing the
game.</p>
<p lang="da-DK" align="LEFT" style="margin-left: 0.5cm; margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">
<font size="2"><span lang="en-US">This is a game that requires
explanation. That statement is already an admission of failure. But
when working with new art forms one has to start somewhere and it's
unfair to an audience to leave a piece of work (even if its not
successful) without some justification. It's probably some kind of
record to have such a small game give hundreds of words of
explanation. [17]</span></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><i>The Marriage</i> can
only be perceived as radical abstraction of the workings of a
relationship if the player understands that the game represents a
marriage at all. An element of communication is integral to
representational games: the player must in some way be convinced to
see the game as a representation of something. The player can <i>then</i>
consider the difference between his or her assumptions and what
actually happens in the game. In <i>The Marriage</i>, the title
certainly suggests that the game can be interpreted as a
representation of a marriage, but the author still feels the need to
further explain the game:</p>
<p lang="da-DK" align="LEFT" style="margin-left: 0.5cm; margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">
<font size="2"><span lang="en-US">The size of each square represents
the amount of space that person is taking up within the marriage. So
for example we often say that one person’s ego is dominating a
marriage or perhaps a large personality. In the game this would be
one square being so large that the other one simply is trapped within
the space of it unable to get to circles and more importantly unable
to “kiss” edge to edge. <br>
[17]</span></font></p>
<h2 class="western">Abstraction as optimization by the player</h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">To play a game is to
learn, and to examine that game's level of abstraction. Additionally,
games often push the player towards optimizing his or her strategy,
and that seems to influence the way players perceive a game. As in
the discussion of real-time strategy players above, an experienced
player may understand the game as a variation on a genre, but a
player not used to the genre may use the fiction to understand what
type of actions are possible in the game. In a study of first person
shooter players, Retaux &amp; Rouchier [9] found that acquiring
proficiency in a game was often accompanied with turning down the
level of detail of the graphics. It would be possible to make the
argument that this constitutes a wholesale shift of focus from the
subject matter of the game - the game as fiction to the game as
rules<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote3anc" href="https://www.jesperjuul.net/text/acertainlevel/#sdendnote3sym"><sup>iii</sup></a></sup>,
and that in certain types of games, this is the standard: the player
starts playing with a focus on the game fiction, and ends up thinking
only about the game as an opportunity for optimizing strategies.
However, for psychological reasons there is great variation between
different games.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">One of the theories of
skill acquisition examines how users learn to separate task-relevant
from task-redundant information:</p>
<p lang="da-DK" align="LEFT" style="margin-left: 0.5cm; margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">
<font size="2"><span lang="en-US">[...] we argue that people learn,
over the course of practice, to separate task-relevant from
task-redundant information and to limit their processing to relevant
aspects of the task. Thus, the information processed early in skill
acquisition may be qualitatively different from the information
processed late in skill acquisition. [performance improvement] may at
least partially reflect systematic reductions in the amount of
information that is processed, rather than changes in the efficiency
with which task components can be performed. </span><span lang="en-US">[3]</span></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Any game that enforces
its goals strongly or is highly competitive, pressuring the player to
improve his or her performance, <i>will</i> push the player towards
information reduction, in order to only think about what is relevant
for the present task. If the fiction is not relevant for the player's
task, it becomes possible for the player to play the game as if it
were an abstract game.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">To <i>ignore</i>
  fiction means that when thinking about the game, you plan your
  strategy by focusing on the rules of the game only, not using the
  knowledge that you have from the game fiction. In a game like Chess,
  this is straightforward: It is possible to play chess without
  considering the societal roles of the pieces, and thinking about the
  societal roles of the pieces is unlikely to be of any help when
  playing the game. On the other hand, while <i>Sims 2 </i>(figure 8,
  Maxis 2004) theoretically could be played as an abstract game
  containing a number of entities with parameters that had to be
  optimized ... it is hard to imagine playing the game without thinking
  about people with emotions<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote4anc" href="https://www.jesperjuul.net/text/acertainlevel/#sdendnote4sym"><sup>iv</sup></a></sup>.</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Finally, the player's
attitude towards a game cannot be simply reduced to one of
optimization: The player may also possess a certain <i>will to
fiction</i>: many players <i>desire</i> make-believe.</p>
<h2 class="western">Space: The unabstractable</h2>

<p class="western" align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><img src="./Jesper Juul_ A Certain Level of Abstraction_files/index_html_675c1da7_300.jpg" alt="SSX 3" width="300" height="225" border="0" align="BOTTOM"></p>

<font size="2"><span lang="en-US">Figure 9. </span><span lang="da-DK"><i>SSX
3</i></span><span lang="en-US"> (EA Canada 2003): This is not
a space.</span></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">There is no space
inside the snowboarding game <i>SSX 3 </i>(figure 9, EA Canada 2003).
There is no snow, there is no snowboarder, there is no mountain, and
there is no space. Some of this just happens to be partially
implemented in the rules of the game: The spatial layout of the
mountain; a somewhat abstracted version of normal laws of physics.
Klevjer has argued that concerning the issue of space, "the
rules-versus-fiction model is dangerously close to the breaking
point" [6].</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Klevjer has a point:
Analytically, we can explain why the space is a fiction, but it is
hardly possible to play the game without <i>perceiving</i> it as
space. Space in video games is special because video games mostly
take place in a space, and because the space usually is part of the
fiction of the game, <i>and</i> is implemented in the rules. In the
same way that <i>Sims 2</i> could theoretically be played as an
abstract game of numbers, so could <i>SSX 3</i>: this would involve a
long series of calculations determining which different variables
were close to each other in value and so on. In practice, this would
be a very hard game.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Most video games have a
straightforward mapping of either a 2d space to a 2d space, or in 3d
games of the 2d space of the screen to the 3d space of the game
world. <i>The Marriage</i>, discussed above, has a 2d allegorical
representation of a relationship - a spatial representation of
something non-spatial. Video game versions of card games are another
example of space that <i>can</i> be abstracted by the player, as the
spatial layout of the screen is irrelevant to the player's
performance in the game.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Humans are not just
general purpose calculators: we have limited overall processing
power, but specialties in certain areas. It is by comparison
straightforward to make a computer program perform long series of
complex mathematical calculations, but much more complicated to
program a character to navigate a complex landscape in a way that
does not look unintelligent to a human observer. Compared to
computers, humans generally have amazing spatial skills. This also
means that problems which can be solved in a spatial way tend to be
solved spatially by humans. This is why it is hard for a player to
abstract from the space in a game.</p>
<h2 class="western">To stick a game in there</h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">"To stick a game
in there", as Lantz was quoted, is then about reducing the
number of possibilities available to the player in order to make a
<i>game</i>. Incidentally, this ties into Salen and Zimmerman's
description of game <i>rules</i> as limiting player action:</p>
<p lang="da-DK" align="LEFT" style="margin-left: 0.5cm; margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.21cm">
<font size="2"><span lang="en-US"><b>Rules limit player action</b></span><span lang="en-US">.
The chief way that rules operate is to limit the activities of the
player. If you are playing the game Yatzee, think of all the things
you could do with the dice in that game: you could light them on
fire, eat them, juggle them, or make jewelry out of them. [10]</span></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">From this perspective,
the level of abstraction has a parallel in non-digital games: the
rules that decide what actions are or are not allowed on a soccer or
baseball pitch can be considered a type of abstraction, abstractions
that remove certain parts of the physical world from the game. The
soccer ball can only be handled in certain ways; the baseball player
actually runs on a 1-dimensional line with a few discrete bases. The
<i>magic circle</i> of games [4] that delineates what is inside from
what is outside the game, is in this perspective not just a visible
spatial boundary, but can be seen as dividing every single object,
action, and player into a component that is part of the game, and a
component that is not a part of the game. Like soccer is a type of
removal or abstraction of many aspects of the world, <i>Dead or Alive
4</i> is an abstraction of fighting, <i>and</i> a video game version
of soccer is an abstraction of the physical game of soccer.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">From a player
perspective, the experience of abstraction is anything but fixed: The
player must identify the genre and the fiction, and then begin to
explore the abstraction of the game: what can be picked up? What
actions are available? And then, perhaps, later abstract away the
fiction and setting of the game while playing the game.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Certain recurring
discussions in video game theory are perhaps really about choosing
between the initial and the retrospective view of a game. But there
is no choice to make: Actual game playing is about building and
modifying one's understanding over time.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">There is a first and a
final impression of game. A player picks up a game, explores it, and
puts it down.</p>
